**Caterpillar Method**

This method involves having a starting point and ending point, usually at the start or the end of an array. And then based on some criteria, you move either one of it.

**Prefix Sum Method**

Prefix means before. prefix sum means the sum of everything before this index. The idea is that in a for loop, the value at this index, is the ones of the previous + current. 

Subsequently, if you are asked to find the total from e.g. index 5 to 10. You just have to take index 10's value and minus away the value at index 5 as that comprises of all the value from 1 to 5.
